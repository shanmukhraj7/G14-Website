				<h3>Organic Wastes</h3>
				<p>The dead organic matter in the water bodies decay and the bacteria carrying out this decay use oxyge. The Source of oxygen in the dissolved oxygen in water that is also used by the aquatic plant and animal life for breathing. The anerobic bacteria release toxic chemicals harmful to living forms while the aerobic bacteria produce biochemical oxygen demand. A water body with low oxygen content is a poor environment for fish and most of the other aquatic plants and animals.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="prosair">
				<h3>Chemical Pollutants</h3>
				<p>Many inorganic chemicals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium,etc., are responsible for water pollution. The sources of these heavy metals are agricultural,urban and industrial waste. The heavy metals often have direct physiology toxic effects. Some are stored or incorporated in living tissue, sometimes permanently. Heavy metals tend to be stored in fatty body tissue. These heavy metals cause significant ecosystem damage and human health problems. The content of heavy metals in our bodies is referred to be as body burden. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="prosair">
				<h3>Eutrophication</h3>
				<p>Eutrophication is a process by which a body of water develops a high concentration of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous(in the form of nitrate and phosphate). These nutrients cause an increase in the growth of aquatic plants in general, as well as production of blue-green bacteria and algae. Algae may form surface mats, shading the water and reducing the light availabity for algae below the surface, thereby greatly reducing photosynthesis. Eutrophication caused by human-induced process such as nutrient-rich sewage water is known as cultural eutrophication.</p>

						<h3>Reduction of souces and sewage treatment</h3>
						<p>It is the most environmental-friendly way of dealing with pollutants. For example, instead of water-cooling towers, air-cooling towers may be used to dispose of waste heat from power plants. This can avoid thermal pollution of water.
							Sewage contains about 99.9 percent of water and about 0.1 percent solid or dissolved waste.
						</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Bioremediation</h3>
						<p>It is the process that uses either naturally occuring or genetically engineered microorganisms, such as yeast, fungi and bacteria, to convert harmful substances into less toxic or non-toxic compounds. In nature, the microorganisms break down a variety of organic compounds to carbon, and obtain energy for their growth and survival. Bioremediation thus promotes the growth of microorganisms to degrade contaminants by utilizing them as carbon and energysources. For example, if leaking petroleum tank pollutes the ground water, the cleanup operations required are very expensive and involve removal and disposal of soil. </p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Nanotechnoogy and Naturalization</h3>
						<p>Nano particles can capture heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic from water because they have a large surface area to volume ratio. With the advancement in nanotechnology, this strategy appears to be a viable option.
							This is an emerging technology that can treat urban run-off before it is discharged into the water bodies. In this method, a closed loop local landscape is created that does not allow run-off to leave a particular area. Besides, Vegetation may be planted in such a manner that drainage is directed to plants and not to streets.
